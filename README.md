# twitter-js

I created a twitter clone in an effort to learn how to set up request routers using Express.js and connect Nunjucks with my database file. I plan on continue working on this project and get real tweets from the Twitter API. The users will be able to view latest twitts and retweet or write a tweet themselves.
